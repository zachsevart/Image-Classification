Image Classification Web Application 
 
 

This repository contains an image classification web application that predicts the expression a human is making. The application is built using Streamlit, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Keras.
Features

    📸 Upload an image to predict the human expression
    ⏱️ Real-time prediction display
    📊 Visualization of the input image and prediction results
    🖥️ Simple and intuitive user interface

Technologies Used

     Streamlit: For creating the web application
     NumPy: For numerical operations
     Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
     Matplotlib: For plotting and visualization
     TensorFlow & 
     Keras: For building and training the image classification model

Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification-web-app.git
cd image-classification-web-app

Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To start the web application, run the following command:

bash

streamlit run app.py

This will launch the web application in your default web browser. You can then upload an image and see the predicted expression.

Model Training

The model used in this application was trained on a dataset of human facial expressions. The training process involved the following steps:

    Data Preprocessing: Images were resized and normalized.
    Model Architecture: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for classification.
    Training: The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
